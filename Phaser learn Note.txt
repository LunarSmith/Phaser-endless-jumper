1. Phaser life cycle per 1 scene

constructor => preload => create (self loop)

2. we cannot use something before declare
    a. this.cameras.main.startFollow(this.player)
    b. this.player = this.physics.add.sprite(240, 320, 'bunny-stand').setScale(0.5)

    we cannot write a before b

3. use class property than local variable for variable use across file
this. platforms >>> const platforms
